# Image Exporter

This Python script resizes and converts PNG images to various formats and resolutions. It also converts PNG images to JPG format with a white background, while maintaining the original DPI when possible.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`PIL`)

You can install Pillow using the following command:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Prepare the Image
   Place the PNG image you want to transform in the folder named `render`.
   Make sure the image is in PNG format and has the .png extension.

2. Run the Script
   Save the provided script in a file named `exportador.py`.
   Open a command line or terminal.
   Navigate to the directory where the `exportador.py` file is located.
   Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python exportador.py
   ```

3. File Locations
   The script will look for the PNG image in the `render` folder.
   The transformed images will be saved in a folder named `salida`, which will be created automatically if it does not exist.

## Script Description

The script performs the following operations:

### Image Loading

- Loads the PNG image from the `render` folder.

### Resizing and PNG Conversion

- Creates PNG versions of the image with the following resolutions:
  - 2000x2000 pixels
  - 400x400 pixels
  - 800x400 pixels
- Each version is saved with a DPI of 72.

### JPG Conversion

- Creates a version of the image with original resolution and original DPI in JPG format.
- Creates JPG versions of the image with the following resolutions:
  - 2000x2000 pixels
  - 400x400 pixels
  - 800x400 pixels
- All JPG versions have a white background and a DPI of 72.

### File Names

- Output files are named using the base name of the original file followed by the image size and format. For example:
  - For an image named `prueba.png`, files such as `prueba_2000px.png`, `prueba_400px.png`, `prueba_800px.png`, `prueba_original.jpg`, etc., will be generated.
